# Simple World Implementation

## Abstract
This project implements a basic vision system for the Blocks World scene. The main goal is to process input images of colored blocks, detect edges, and lay the foundation for 3D scene reconstruction—all using classical computer vision algorithms.

## Framework
- Language: Python  
- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Code
- All code for preprocessing and edge detection is contained in the repository.
- Input images are analyzed step by step from grayscale conversion to edge detection.

## Attribution
- Based on techniques in “Foundations of Computer Vision” by Torralba, Isola, Freeman.
- Uses OpenCV (https://opencv.org/) and NumPy (https://numpy.org/) for processing.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Place your input images in the data folder.
3. Run the Python scripts in the code folder.
4. Results are saved to the results folder.

## Results
The results folder contains processed images for each pipeline step, useful for analysis and reporting.
