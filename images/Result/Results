# Results – Simple World Implementation

This folder contains example outputs generated by the Simple World Implementation pipeline.  
Each result illustrates one or more stages of the classical computer vision processing: preprocessing, edge detection, line classification, figure–ground separation, and simple world coordinate mapping.

## 1. Example Image: simple_world_1.png

Files:

- `simple_world_1_original.png`  
  - Copy of the input Simple World scene used as the starting point.

- `simple_world_1_gray.png`  
  - Grayscale version of the original image, used for all further processing.

- `simple_world_1_edges.png`  
  - Canny edge map showing the main boundaries of the blocks as white edges on a black background.

- `simple_world_1_lines.png`  
  - Original image with detected line segments overlaid.  
  - Green lines mark vertical edges; red lines mark horizontal edges.

- `simple_world_1_figure_mask.png`  
  - Binary figure/ground mask.  
  - White pixels correspond to the block structure; black pixels correspond to background.

- `simple_world_1_figure_only.png`  
  - Original image with the mask applied so that only the blocks (figure) remain; the background is removed.

- `simple_world_1_world_coordinates.png`  
  - Multi‑panel figure including:
    - Original image  
    - Detected edges  
    - Edge classification (green vertical / red horizontal)  
    - X world coordinate map (intensity increases left to right)  
    - Y world coordinate map (intensity increases top to bottom)  
    - Z world coordinate map (flat depth visualized with a colorbar)

- `simple_world_1_3d_surface.png`  
  - 3D surface plot generated from the X, Y, and Z coordinate maps.  
  - In the current implementation Z is constant, so the surface is a flat plane; this can be extended to different depths per block in future work.

## 2. Example Image: simple_world_2.png

(Repeat the same structure briefly for a second image, or just mention that similar files exist.)

For `simple_world_2.png`, the results follow the same naming pattern and demonstrate that the pipeline generalizes to other Simple World layouts.

## 3. How to Reproduce the Results

1. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.  
2. Run the main notebook `CV_Final_Project_Manasa_Maram-Final.ipynb` (or the script in `code/`).  
3. The outputs will be written automatically into the `results/` folder with the filenames listed above.

These sample images are intended for use in the written report and the project video to visually demonstrate each stage of the Simple World vision pipeline.
